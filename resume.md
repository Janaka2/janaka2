## Summary
Senior Java/Spring engineer with 18+ years delivering resilient banking platforms (UBS, Credit Suisse) and enterprise systems. I modernize core systems, reduce latency, and ship practical AI automation—LLMs, RAG, LangChain/LlamaIndex—integrated into Spring Boot backends and enterprise DevOps. Calm, accountable, and outcome-driven; I take end-to-end ownership and leave teams stronger.

## Core Strengths
- **Banking & Trading:** FX/trading backends, FIX protocol knowledge, case management (due diligence, high-risk), cash & card systems  
- **Modernization:** microservices, Kafka streaming, refactoring legacy apps, APIs (REST/GraphQL), observability  
- **AI in Production:** RAG pipelines, prompt/parameter optimization, agentic workflows, n8n orchestration  
- **DevOps:** OpenShift/Kubernetes/Docker, GitHub Actions/Jenkins CI/CD, GitOps, Helm; logging/metrics with Splunk/Grafana  
- **Data & DB:** Oracle/PLSQL, Liquibase, performance tuning; Kafka streams for high-volume search/analytics

## Selected Achievements
- Improved responsiveness of a high-volume FX trading platform by ~20% by optimizing Java backend design and applying FIX insights.  
- Built a high-performance Master Data Management tool (GBSS MDM) from scratch; ongoing enhancements and integrations.  
- Delivered multiple case-management solutions (due-diligence, high-risk), integrating streaming for high-volume search & data-lake analysis.  
- Modernized 20+ UBS components (Java 8, Spring, Apache Camel, OAS/Swagger); automated pipelines and improved test coverage (Cucumber BDD).  
- Prototyped local LLMs (Llama-3) and fine-tuned inference pipelines for task-specific automations supporting banking workflows.
